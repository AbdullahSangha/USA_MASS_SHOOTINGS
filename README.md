# USA Mass Shootings EDA
Mass shootings are incidents involving multiple victims of firearm-related violence. Studies indicate that the rate at which public mass shootings occur has tripled since 2011. Between 1982 and 2011, a mass shooting occurred roughly once every 200 days. However, between 2011 and 2014, that rate has accelerated greatly with at least one mass shooting occurring every 64 days in the United States. Post 2014, this rate has further increased and is still on the rise.

Higher accessibility and ownership of guns has been cited as a reason for the high rate of mass shootings. The USA has the highest per-capita gun ownership in the world with 120.5 firearms per 100 people.
